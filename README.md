## Introduction

In this project, you'll learn how to create a dropdown button using HTML and JavaScript. A dropdown button provides a user-friendly way to present options or a menu when clicked. This project is ideal for web developers who want to enhance user interaction on their websites.

## Features

- **Dropdown Button:** Create a button that, when clicked, displays a dropdown menu.
- **Menu Options:** Define menu items that appear when the button is clicked.
- **JavaScript Functionality:** Implement JavaScript to show and hide the menu when the button is clicked.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow the instructions below:

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- A text editor or integrated development environment (IDE) for web development.
- Basic knowledge of HTML and JavaScript.

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/ameer-ali-jamali/Assignment-16-Visibility-Dropdown-Button-HTML-CSS.git
   ```

2. Open the project files in your text editor or IDE.

## Usage

1. Create an HTML file and add a button element that will serve as the dropdown button.
2. Define a container, such as a `div` or `ul`, to hold the menu options. Initially, hide this container using CSS (`display: none;`) to make it invisible.
3. Implement JavaScript functionality to show and hide the menu container when the button is clicked. You can use event listeners and DOM manipulation for this purpose.
4. Inside the menu container, add menu items as needed using HTML elements like `a` for links or `div` for custom options.
5. Style the button, menu container, and menu items with CSS to make them visually appealing.
6. Test your dropdown button by opening the HTML file in a web browser and ensuring that the dropdown menu appears and disappears when the button is clicked.

Feel free to customize the dropdown button's appearance, behavior, and menu options to suit your project's requirements.
